# Netflix Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Overview

This project aims to conduct an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Netflix dataset to gain insights into the content available on the platform. By exploring various aspects such as the distribution of movies and TV shows, release years, genres, and more, we aim to understand patterns and trends in Netflix's content catalog.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis is the ["Netflix Movies and TV Shows"](https://www.kaggle.com/shivamb/netflix-shows) dataset from Kaggle. This dataset contains information about movies and TV shows available on Netflix as of 2021.

## Process for EDA

1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing:**
   - Load the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.
   - Clean the data by handling missing values, data types, and other inconsistencies.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis:**
   - Analyze the distribution of movies and TV shows.
   - Explore the distribution of content across different countries and regions.
   - Investigate trends in release years and content additions over time.
   - Identify popular genres and their prevalence in the dataset.
   - Analyze the distribution of content ratings.
   - Explore the duration of movies and TV shows available on Netflix.

3. **Data Visualization:**
   - Create visualizations such as histograms, bar charts, pie charts, and word clouds to represent the findings of the analysis.
   - Use seaborn, matplotlib, and other Python libraries to visualize the data effectively.
